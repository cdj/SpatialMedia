SpatialMedia
============

Work from my Spatial Media class at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program

## Assignments
### 1.9 Protoype: Line Jumper
Address one of your technical challenges with a prototype. This might include things like testing a computer vision library, testing projection on a physical mockup, or vetting the feasibility of an input sensor.
### 2.0 Prototype: One-to-one interaction with TSPS
For the first prototype, build a simple one-to-one interaction with TSPS. Think about how the output, placement of the camera, and type of data youâ€™re looking for can all reinforce the nature of the interaction.
### 2.0 Prototype: Many-to-one interaction with TSPS
The second TSPS prototype should be a many-to-one interactive: at least three people must be able to interact with a single output at once.
