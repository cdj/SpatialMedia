# Light Strings

To encourage social interaction at a fundraiser, "strings" are projected between tables. When people walk across these strings, they are "plucked" and create different sounds.

This program creates that effect in openFramworks, using mouse input or camera input (from TSPS) to pluck the strings. There is a special projection mode that can be used for the actual installation at the fundraiser, removing the simulated tables from the screen and allowing for projection mapping on the dance floor.
